        <p>Our goal in this chapter is to convince you that writing a computer program is easier than writing a piece of text such as a paragraph or an essay. In this chapter, we take you through these building blocks, get you started on programming in Java, and study a variety of interesting programs. </p>
        
        <h2>Guide to Programming Languages</h2>
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>What it is: Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the 1990s. It's one of the most in-demand programming languages, a standard for enterprise software, web-based content, games and mobile apps, as well as the Android operating system. Java is designed to work across multiple software platforms, meaning a program written on Mac OS X, for example, could also run on Windows.</p>
        <h3>C#</h3>
        <p>What it is: Pronounced "C-sharp," C# is a multi-paradigm language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. Combining principles from C and C++, C# is a general-purpose language used to develop software for Microsoft and Windows platforms.</p>
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>What it is: JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of its syntax from C. It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions. It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications. JavaScript interpreters are embedded in Google's Chrome extensions, Apple's Safari extensions, Adobe Acrobat and Reader, and Adobe's Creative Suite.</p>
        <h2>IT English for programmers</h2>
        <p>Most articles, knowledge bases, books and so on are in English, so if you want to read up on something in depth, you need to have at least basic reading skills in English. Translating tooltips inside Visual Studio could end up causing confusion for at least new developers, as what they would see on-screen potentially did not match up with what the tutorial/book they were following.</p>
